  "character_desc": "An 8-year-old boy with light brown skin, bright blue eyes, and messy blond hair, has freckles, wears a green sweater, brown pants, warm boots, and a red scarf wrapped around his neck.",
  "story": "The world had ended in a catastrophic apocalypse, but amidst the ruins, a strange green moss began to grow. It covered the ancient stones, making them look like they were worn by time, not destruction. [SCENE_BREAK] Steve, a young boy, wandered through the ruins, fascinated by the moss's gentle glow. [SCENE_BREAK] As he walked, the moss grew thicker, forming a soft, green carpet under his feet. [SCENE_BREAK] The air was filled with an otherworldly silence, broken only by the faint sound of Christmas bells. [SCENE_BREAK] Steve followed the sound, his heart filled with wonder, and discovered a small Christmas tree hidden among the ruins. [SCENE_BREAK] The tree was covered in green moss, and its branches were decorated with tiny, glowing ornaments. [SCENE_BREAK] Steve smiled, feeling a sense of magic in the desolate world, and reached out to touch the tree's soft, mossy branches. [SCENE_BREAK] In that moment, Steve felt a sense of peace, and the green moss seemed to glow brighter, as if it too felt the joy of Christmas. [SCENE_BREAK] ",
